# Stay In Touch

A small ClojureScript app used as an example in my conference talk ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6dZ1wPcGg]("Smoooth Feedback Loops", Klarna Konferense 2018)).

The app suggests you when to contact friends that are far away.

To run (in development mode): `lein figwheel`  
To build: `lein cljsbuild once min`
